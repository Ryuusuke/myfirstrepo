      <p class=list ><mark>Hi peeps. I'm a junior in a highschool called Queens Vocational and Technical HS. Being a junior is a bit stressful but i'm just a kid so in reality i'm just complaining. I can say for sure that this year is the busiest year in high school for me. I'm 17 and will be turning 18 in a couple of months. Weird right? An almost 18 year old in junior year high school. There's a reason for that. Basically I took an extra unecessary grade back in the Philippines where I was born.  Another thing about me is that I watch anime. I've watched a lot but my all time favorites are Naruto, Deathnote, and Fullmetal Alchemist.</mark></p>

      <p class=list> <mark>I play a MOBA called League of Legends which I play for extended long periods of time and get angry at. Yet I still play it because it's fun. In League of Legends, players assume the role of a character, called a "champion", with unique abilities, battling with a team against other player or computer-controlled champions. In the most popular game modes, each team's goal is to destroy the opposing team's nexus, a building which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends game is discrete, with all champions starting off each game fairly weak and progressing by accumulating gold and experience over the course of the game. Yeah I just got that definition from wikipedia since i'm not that good at explaining stuff.</mark></p>
